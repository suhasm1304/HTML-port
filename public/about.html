<h1><center>About me</center></h1>
<p><center>"My name is Suhas M, and I hail from a quaint village named Sonnamaranahalli, situated in the serene and picturesque Doddaballapur Taluk of Bengaluru District. Growing up in this peaceful environment has instilled in me a strong sense of belonging and pride in my roots.

Currently, I am pursuing my engineering degree at the prestigious University Visvesvaraya College of Engineering (UVCE) in Bengaluru, a historic institution known for its academic excellence and vibrant campus life. Being part of UVCE has been an enriching experience, both academically and personally.

To fully immerse myself in the college culture and focus on my studies, I reside at the UVCE Boys' Hostel. Hostel life has offered me a unique opportunity to form lasting friendships, share diverse experiences, and grow in a supportive community of like-minded peers.

This journey, from my humble beginnings in Sonnamaranahalli to the bustling city of Bengaluru, has been one of growth, learning, and endless possibilities."
